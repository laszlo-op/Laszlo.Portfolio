	  <h3> Where it started </h3>
	 <p> My family travels a lot, and as soon as I was old enough, I would take my dad's phone and take pictures of the places we were going. When I lived in Bolivia, we went on many hikes, and I loved to take photos of the beautiful landscapes we saw. 
 	<p> However, the first time I ever used a real digital camera was when I went to Kenya during the first week of 2022. Ever since then, I have been eager to get back to Africa and take much more photos of wildlife.
